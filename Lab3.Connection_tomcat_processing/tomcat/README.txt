In order to do this excersice you need to download XAMPP
https://www.apachefriends.org/es/index.html 
It consists mainly of the MySQL database management system, 
the Apache web server and the interpreters for PHP and Perl 
script languages. You can also download tomcat from its web page
http://tomcat.apache.org/ 
Once you have download the software you need to go to 
localhost:8080 and it will open a web page where they give you
examples and much more. 
Then you are going to creat as follow, in my case I have
C:\xampp\tomcat\webapps in this folder you are going to create 
another folder by the name of your proyect in my case 
"FakeSensor" here is where you have to do has followed. 
The only thing that must change is the src file that in my case
